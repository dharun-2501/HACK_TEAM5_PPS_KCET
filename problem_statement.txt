
Problem Statement

Estimate Monthly Expenses Based on Lifestyle

ML Algorithm: Linear Regression

Domain: Personal Finance

Problem Statement:

Build a model to estimate a person's monthly expenses based on their lifestyle habits. Use a Google Form to gather

Number of outings per month

- Monthly shopping frequency

- Mobile/data recharge cost

- Food ordering frequency

- Rent or hostel fee (if any)

Use the data to predict total estimated expenses for the month using linear regression. Evaluate the model with MAE or RMSE.

Instructions:

1. Create a Google Form

Objective:

Design a Google Form based on your chosen problem statement to collect relevant data that can be used to build a dataset.

1. Design the Google Form:

- Use a clear title that reflects your problem statement.


Add a short description explaining the purpose of the form (optional but recommended).

2. Add Questions:

- Start with a field to collect the Name of the respondent.

- Do NOT include phone numbers, email addresses, or any other personal contact details

- Include only the questions that are directly useful for building your dataset.

- Use appropriate input types (e.g., multiple choice, dropdown, short answer, linear scale) based on the data you want to collect.

3. Share the Form:

Share the form only in the internship WhatsApp group.

Ask your classmates to fill out the form honestly and completely.

Reminder:

Ensure your form is neat, relevant, and easy to understand. Your goal is to collect clean and useful data for your machine learning (ML) or data analysis project.

2. Collect Dataset

- Every student must fill out the forms for other teams.

- Collect at least 40 responses.

Download the responses as a CSV file.

3. Data Preprocessing

- Load the CSV into your code.

- Clean the data:

- Remove null values

- Encode categorical variables

- Normalise/scale if needed

4. Model Building

- Identify whether your problem is a classification or regression problem.

- Choose a Suitable algorithm.

- Train Your Model


- Evaluate using metrics like :

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 (for classification)

- MAE, MSE, RMSE (for regression)

5. Save Your Model

- Save your model file based on the type:

- pkl-Scikit-learn

- h5-TensorFlow/Keras

6. Make a Prediction

- Take a sample input and show output using your saved model.

- This could be a classification label or a numeric prediction.
